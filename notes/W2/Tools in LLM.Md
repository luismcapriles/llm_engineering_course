# Tools in LLMs  

Tools are essentially external capabilities or functions that allow the AI to extend its abilities beyond just generating text. Think of Tools like special attachments or add-ons that help the LLM interact with the world more dynamically and solve more complex problems.  

## What Are Tools?  

Tools in LLMs are predefined functions or capabilities that allow the AI to:  

1. Perform specific actions  
2. Access external information  
3. Interact with other systems or software  
4. Extend its problem-solving capabilities  

## Examples of Tools  

Some practical examples of Tools include:  

- **Calculator Tool** – Allows the LLM to perform mathematical calculations  
- **Web Search Tool** – Enables the LLM to retrieve current information  
- **Code Execution Tool** – Lets the LLM run and test programming code  
- **Database Query Tool** – Enables searching through structured information  
- **Scheduling Tool** – Interacts with calendar systems  

## Conceptual Example  

### Without a Tool:  
If you ask an LLM, *"What's 15% of 240?"*, it might try to calculate the answer within its text response.  

### With a Calculator Tool:  
The LLM can use a precise calculation function and return the exact result: **36**.
