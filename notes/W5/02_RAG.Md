# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Explained

RAG is a powerful approach that combines the strengths of retrieval systems with generative language models to produce more accurate, factual responses. Here's how it works:

## Core Concept

RAG combines two key components:
1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
2. **Generation**: Using that information to create coherent, contextual responses

## How RAG Works

1. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question, the system processes it to understand what information is needed.

2. **Vectorization**: In order the system to understand this input, the text is converted into [vector embeddings](https://github.com/luismcapriles/llm_engineering_course/blob/main/notes/W5/01_Intro_to_embedding_llms.Md) using Encoding LLM.


3. **Retrieval**: The system searches through a knowledge base (documents, databases, etc.) to find information relevant to the query. This often involves:
   - Converting text into vector embeddings
   - Using semantic search to find relevant content
   - Ranking and selecting the most pertinent information

4. **Context Augmentation**: The retrieved information is added to the prompt sent to the language model.

5. **Generation**: The LLM uses both the query and the retrieved context to generate a response that's grounded in specific, relevant information.

6.**Answer**: User get the LLM response.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Improved Factuality**: Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved facts
- **Up-to-date Information**: Can access current information beyond the model's training cutoff
- **Domain Specialization**: Can be tailored to specific domains by changing the knowledge base
- **Transparency**: Allows citing sources for the information provided
- **Reduced Training Costs**: More efficient than retraining models with new data

## Implementation Considerations

- **Vector Databases**: Tools like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus are commonly used to store and search embeddings
- **Chunking Strategy**: How documents are split affects retrieval quality
- **Embedding Quality**: The choice of embedding model impacts semantic search accuracy
- **Prompt Engineering**: How retrieved context is integrated into prompts significantly affects results
- **Reranking**: Additional ranking steps can improve the relevance of retrieved documents

RAG represents a key advancement in making LLMs more reliable and useful for real-world applications by connecting them to external knowledge sources.

>Notes:
1. RAG works best on documents that contain natural language, organized into paragraphs (or any kind of chunk) of information that might provide useful context for answering questions.
So there's no concern with having Excel files - but there might be a concern if they only contain numbers.
An Excel file with customer feedback might be valuable during a RAG flow. An Excel file with customer purchase history might be less useful initially - you'd need to write something to extract and organize the data in a way that's most suited for vectorization & retrieval.
